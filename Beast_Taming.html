		<p>Beast Taming is the most unique of the Guilds. Beast tamers capture threatening beasts or breed them with current numbers to use as companions for Guardians. I don't think anything in my database is any scarier then the sight of a Behemoth horde covered in armor chargeing into battle. Beast Taming is dangerous for obvious reasons, thus only someone with the reflexes to take on fast preditor beasts should even attempt to tame them. I always wondered why we bother with beasts but apparently my opinion is false and garbage...thanks Lysander</p>

			<li>Description - Lysander is one of the oldest members of the Guardians. she has tamed and trained animals most would think impossible to tame. Lysander has a distain for males, spending your life dealing with Guardians and Alpha male animals could cause anyone to think that. She has anther reason which is -Redacted- so her distain can be further excused. Lysandar speaks her opinion loudly, even amoung Guardian standards. She has been given the least missions out of any Guardian of her rank, which suits her since she spends most of her time training mounts and warbeasts to support Guardians. from the common horse or wolf companion to behemoths and gryphons Lysander has trained it</li>

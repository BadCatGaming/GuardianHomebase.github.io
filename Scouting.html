		<p>Scouting is actually more volunteering then a Guild, although due to their efforts the Guardian information web is one of the greatest. Despite the risks of being the first to investigate Scouts have a good survivability. Mostly thanks to the amount of training Mark puts them through. If your female try not to fall in love with Mark, he is completely dense with love and still doesn't realize he currently has four of his "friends" trying to court him. Damn that face though</p>

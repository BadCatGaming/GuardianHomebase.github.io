		<p>Rune Crafting is creating magically imbued Runes for many purposes. They can be imbued into weapons to increase durability or become wreathed in flames. Runes can create armor that will deflect projectiles back at attackers or heal minor wounds. Runes are also used to create magic charges for traps and cheaper casting. Rune smiths work hand in hand with blacksmiths most of the time. And many blacksmiths also work as Rune smiths</p>

			<li>Description - Dwarmair is a gruff Dwarven Rune Smith. His skills at enchanting equipment and armor are highly sought after. Dwarmair tends to smack anyone he doesn't like with his hammer, bothering him while he is working is a whacking. bothering him on a break is a whacking. being named Mort is a whack and a half. behind his rough exterior is a kind soul. He works hard to make sure his Runes will never fail the Guardians who rely on them. His teaching style is brutal, but you will learn faster then with anyone else</li>

			<p><br></p>
			<li>Dangers - As long as you don't give Dwarmair a reason to hit you thier is next to no danger. Recommended combat rank Apprentice</li>

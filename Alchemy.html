		<p>Alchemy is brewing and experimenting with potions and poisons. Rose is in charge of the labs, but anyone who has any experiance with the field knows to stay away from  her lab and work in any other. While nobody has outright died by her actions PTSD tends to discourage most. you could consider Veteran rank on par with grandmaster for Alchemy. Potions come in a variety of uses, the main two potions that are the focus of the Guild are Health potions and Mana potions. currently while Health potions can bring back limbs the recipe is extremly expensive. the only mass producing version of the Health potion is a low tier one that can close an arrow or bullet wound at best, each costing roughly a castle. Mana potions are in a different boat, the resources aren't that expensive comparably but the effect is poor. drinking more then a single Mana potion in a week could seriously harm the subjects health. The current greatest Mana potion is able to recharge 23.87% of a persons Mana pool.</p>
		<p>Other potions are to weak, such as strength potions, to useless, such as greekfire, or fully developed, such as invisibility potions, to have much development interest among the Alchemists. Poisons are extremely developed and have a variety of types, From paralysis to instant death. Most Guardians dip their toes into Alchemy to have experiance to brew certain potions with materials they find in the field</p>

She does countless of dangerous and death defying experiments that most of the time end in failure. however she is considered the greatest Alchemical mind of her time. She joined the Guardians just before the -Redacted- standing with Mort in the end. She is one of the oldest members of the Guardians, yet her combat skills are sub par compared to her time.
